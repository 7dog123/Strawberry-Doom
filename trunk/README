Strawberry Doom is a Doom source port which aims to behave as closely
as possible to the original DOS Doom executables.

Strawberry Doom aims to:

 * Be compatible with DOS Doom demos
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom configuration files
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom savegames
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom bugs
 * Provide en enhanced "feel" as DOS Doom (display and input should behave
   the same)
 * As far as possible, add features that are not available
   using the DOS version.

== Setting up gameplay ==

For instructions on how to set up Strawberry Doom for play, see the
INSTALL file.

== Configuration File ==

Strawberry Doom is compatible with the DOS Doom configuration file
(normally named 'default.cfg').  Existing configuration files for DOS
Doom should therefore simply work out of the box.  However, Strawberry
Doom also provides some extra settings.  These are stored in a
separate file named 'strawberry-doom.cfg'.

The configuration can be edited using the strawberry-setup tool.

== Command-line options ==

For a complete list of command-line options, see the CMDLINE file.

== Playing TCs ==

With Vanilla Doom there is no way to include sprites in PWAD files.
Strawberry Doom's '-file' command line option behaves exactly the same
as Vanilla Doom, and trying to play TCs by adding the WAD files using
'-file' will not work.

Many Total Conversions (TCs) are distributed as a PWAD file which must
be merged into the main IWAD.  Typically a copy of DEUSF.EXE is
included which performs this merge.  Strawberry Doom includes a new
option, '-merge', which will simulate this merge.  Essentially, the
WAD directory is merged in memory, removing the need to modify the
IWAD on disk.

To play TCs using Strawberry Doom, run like this:

  strawberry-doom -merge thetc.wad

Here are some examples:

  strawberry-doom -merge batman.wad -deh batman.deh vbatman.deh  (Batman Doom)
  strawberry-doom -merge aoddoom1.wad -deh aoddoom1.deh  (Army of Darkness Doom)
